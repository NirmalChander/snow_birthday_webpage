                <p>Dear Snow,</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                From the very first moment I met you, I knew there was something extraordinary about you.
                Your laughter is like a melody that brightens even the dullest days.
                You are an angel in human form—a source of light, kindness, and beauty in this world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today is not just your birthday—it also marks a year since life blessed me with your presence again.
                I still remember that moment so vividly: the day I sent you a birthday wish, unsure if you’d respond.
                And then, as if fate had been waiting for its moment, you replied.
                That reply wasn’t just a message; it was the beginning of something I didn’t even know I needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past year, having you back in my life has been nothing short of a miracle.
                Every conversation, every shared moment with you feels like a precious gift.
                You’ve shown me what it truly means to connect with someone and reminded me how incredible it feels
                to have someone who understands and inspires you.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the world celebrates your special day, I find myself wishing I could be there with you—
                to see your laughter, to share your joy, and to make this day as beautiful as you are.
                It pains me that I can’t celebrate with you in person, but please know that my heart is with you every
                moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am endlessly grateful to have you in my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Snow, You are not just beautiful—you are stunning, both inside and out. You make life feel magical,
                and I feel so fortunate to be part of your journey.
                If there’s one thing I wish for you today, it’s to know just how special you are to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I look forward to all the moments, big and small, that we’ll continue to share together.
                I can’t wait to see where life takes us because every step feels brighter with you by my side.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wish you a year filled with love, laughter, and all the success you dream of.
                May your days always be as beautiful as you are.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every moment with you feels like living in a beautiful dream.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are a treasure—a gift for me lucky enough to know you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for being the incredible person you are and for making every moment we’ve shared so
                meaningful.
                You are, and always will be, the most important person in my life.
